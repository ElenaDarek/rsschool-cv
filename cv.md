## Summary

Having started my career as a layout designer in one russian group of companies with a quite low skills level, so far I became more profficient in web design.

As a Frontеnd-Developer, I already have a quite good grasp of basic web technologies like HTML, CSS, jQuery, JavaScript, PHP and such CMS like WordPress, Netcat and etc. But more complex technology jobs may be looking for me more specialized in certain areas.
In the meantime I try to be a reliable teamplayer and have strong communication skills. 

## Skills and Proficiency:
* HTML5, CSS3
* JavaScript, PHP Basics
* Version control: Git (remote service GitHub).
* VS Code
* Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Figma

## Code examples

```js
function testCycle(n) {
  var x = 0;
    for(var i = 1; i <= n; i++){
      x += i;
    }
    return x;
}
```
And some more:

```js
function testStr(a, b) {
    var string1 = a.toUpperCase();
    var string2 = b.toLowerCase();
    strings = string1 .concat(string2);
    return strings;
}
```
